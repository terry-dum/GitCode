1) git init - to create a repository

2) git status

3) git add <filename>, git add --all, git add -A, git add .
- to track the file (if we make any changes)

4) git commit -m "message"

5) git diff - to see what file had been changed and the content inside

6) git restore --staged <filename> - to untrack all the file

7) git commit -a -m "message" - equal to git add + git commit

8) git rm/ git restore - git rm is same as u delete in GUI

9) my understanding, rm need to stage and commit, git rm can directly commit

10) git log
git log --oneline
git commit -m "changed commit comment" --amend - used to change the comment for the latest commit

11) git log -p - used to see exactly what changes to file had been made

12) git help log

13) git reset xxxxxx
xxxxxx -> can see from git log --oneline

14) git rebase.... :x to quit.... >>ignore first

15) git branch <name>

16) git branch - what branch you currently have and branch u currently at

17) git switch <name>

18) git merge -m "comment" <branch name> - go to main branch and type this to merge changes from other branch

19) git branch -d <name> - to delete branch after u done

20) git switch -c <name> - to create and switch branch

21) when u try to merge, if merge conflict, u will bring to main|merging branch, then u go into the merging file and decide which u want, and u make changes, then u commit

22) git push --all - to push all the branch to github

23) git fecth + git merge = git pull
